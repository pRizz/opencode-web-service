# Phase [15] Plan [03]: Wizard and Command Integration Summary

**Setup wizard prompts for image source preference, update command respects config to pull or build, status displays provenance**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-24T23:19:40Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-24T23:25:40Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Setup wizard asks user whether to pull prebuilt image (~2 min) or build from source (30-60 min)
- Update command branches to build_image or pull_image based on config.image_source setting
- Status command shows "Image src: prebuilt from ghcr.io" or "Image src: built from source" when state file exists

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add image source prompt to setup wizard** - `22c0cf8` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update command respects image_source config** - `95fa9dc` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Status command shows image provenance** - `ca8bcf8` (feat)

_Note: Commit `3cb380e` was an auto-commit from rustfmt between tasks_

## Files Created/Modified
- `packages/cli-rust/src/wizard/mod.rs` - Added image_source to WizardState, prompt_image_source function, applies to config
- `packages/cli-rust/src/wizard/summary.rs` - Display image source with time estimate in summary table
- `packages/cli-rust/src/commands/update.rs` - Branch to build_image or pull_image based on config.image_source, save provenance
- `packages/cli-rust/src/commands/status.rs` - Display image provenance from state file

## Decisions Made

**1. Image source prompt in both quick and full setup**
- **Decision:** Wizard always asks for image source preference, even in quick setup mode
- **Rationale:** Choice between 2-minute pull vs 60-minute build is significant enough to warrant explicit user input
- **Impact:** Quick setup now has 2 steps (auth + image), full setup has 4 steps (auth + image + port + bind)

**2. Informational messages in update command**
- **Decision:** Display which method (build/pull) is being used and how to change it
- **Rationale:** Users should understand what's happening and have clear path to change behavior
- **Implementation:** Shows "Info: Pulling prebuilt image (per config.image_source=prebuilt)" with dim hint "To build from source: occ config set image_source build"

**3. Graceful provenance display**
- **Decision:** Status shows provenance if state file exists, silently skips if missing
- **Rationale:** State file is operational/ephemeral, may not exist on older installations
- **Implementation:** `if let Some(state) = load_state()` pattern - no error if missing

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

**Issue 1: Type mismatch in wizard steps**
- **Problem:** Initially used `u8` for total_steps but other prompt functions use `usize`
- **Resolution:** Changed prompt_image_source signature to use `usize` for consistency
- **Impact:** Minimal - quick fix during implementation

**Issue 2: update_image returns UpdateResult, not string**
- **Problem:** Plan assumed update_image returns full_image string for registry detection
- **Resolution:** Call pull_image directly (which returns string) after tag_current_as_previous
- **Impact:** Cleaner separation - tag backup, then pull/build, then save state

**Issue 3: Leftover incomplete work in start.rs**
- **Problem:** start.rs had unused imports and incomplete implementation from phase 15-02
- **Resolution:** Reset start.rs to HEAD and removed unused imports in update.rs
- **Impact:** Kept focus on current plan scope (wizard + update + status only)

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Image source preference fully integrated into user workflow (wizard → config → commands)
- Update command respects preference when acquiring new images
- Status provides transparency about image provenance
- Ready for Phase 15-02 to implement pull-prebuilt in start command (currently it only builds)
- Ready for Phase 16 (Code Quality Audit) to review nesting, duplication, and overall code health
