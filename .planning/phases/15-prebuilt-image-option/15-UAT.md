## Current Test

All tests passed.

## Tests

### 1. Config has image_source field
expected: Run `just run config show` - should display `image_source` field with default value "prebuilt"
result: pass
note: Required fix - config show was rewritten to use serde auto-serialization (commit 16bc487)

### 2. Config has update_check field
expected: Run `just run config show` - should display `update_check` field with default value "always"
result: pass
note: Fixed alongside test 1

### 3. Start command shows new flags in help
expected: Run `just run start --help` - should list --pull-sandbox-image, --cached-rebuild-sandbox-image, --full-rebuild-sandbox-image, --no-update-check
result: pass

### 4. Image flags are mutually exclusive
expected: Run `just run start --pull-sandbox-image --full-rebuild-sandbox-image` - should error with "Only one of..." message
result: pass

### 5. Setup wizard prompts for image source
expected: Run `just run setup` - wizard should ask "How would you like to get the Docker image?" with options for prebuilt (~2 min) and build (30-60 min)
result: pass

### 6. Update command respects image_source config
expected: With `image_source=prebuilt` in config, `just run update` should pull (not build) - check messaging indicates pull
result: pass

### 7. Status shows image provenance
expected: When image-state.json exists, `just run status` should show "Image src: prebuilt from ghcr.io" (or "built from source")
result: pass
note: Verified by creating test state file - works correctly when state exists

## Fixes Applied During UAT

### Fix 1: Config show auto-includes all fields (commit 16bc487)

**Problem:** `just run config show` didn't display `image_source` or `update_check` fields because show.rs manually listed each field.

**Solution:** Rewrote config show to use serde serialization - serialize Config to JSON Value and iterate over all fields automatically. New fields can never be missed.

**Key changes:**
- Uses `serde_json::to_value(config)` to get all fields
- Applies special formatting only for sensitive fields (passwords)
- Added test that verifies image_source and update_check are serialized

### Fix 2: Reduced nesting in config show (commit 9531d23)

**Problem:** User requested reduced nesting for better readability.

**Solution:** Refactored show.rs with early returns, helper functions, let...else patterns, and matches! macro.
