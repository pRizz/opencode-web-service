# Roadmap: opencode-cloud

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a cross-platform CLI toolkit for deploying opencode as a persistent cloud service. Starting with project foundation and CLI skeletons, we build up Docker management, service lifecycle commands, platform-specific service installation, an interactive setup wizard, security/authentication, update capabilities, and finish with polish and documentation. Each phase delivers a coherent, testable capability that builds toward the core value: developers accessing a persistent, secure opencode instance from anywhere.

### Phase 6: Security and Authentication
**Goal**: Service is secure by default with explicit opt-in for network exposure
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: SECU-01, SECU-02, SECU-03, SECU-04
**Note**: PAM-based authentication - opencode authenticates via PAM, so opencode-cloud manages system users in the container. Credentials are stored in the container's /etc/shadow (not in host config file). Users are tracked in config.users[] for persistence across rebuilds.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Basic authentication is required to access the opencode web UI
  2. User manages container users via `occ user add/remove/list/passwd/enable/disable`
  3. Service binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default
  4. User must explicitly configure network exposure (0.0.0.0 binding)
  5. Warning is displayed when enabling network exposure
  6. Service works correctly behind AWS ALB/ELB with SSL termination (trust_proxy config)
**Plans**: 5 plans

**Note**: Extends the CLI to manage opencode instances across multiple machines via SSH tunnels to remote Docker daemons. Uses system ssh command for compatibility with existing SSH infrastructure (keys, agents, jump hosts).
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can add remote hosts via `occ host add <name> <hostname>`
  2. User can list and manage hosts with `occ host list/show/edit/remove`
  3. Secure connection via SSH tunnel (uses existing SSH keys/agent)
  4. All container commands support `--host` flag for remote operations
  5. Default host can be set, commands use it when `--host` not specified
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Core host module (schema, storage, SSH tunnel, error types)
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — Host CLI commands (add, remove, list, show, edit, test, default)
- [x] 11-03-PLAN.md — Command routing (--host flag, DockerClient remote, output prefixing)

### Phase 12: Web Desktop UI Investigation

### Phase 14: Versioning and Release Automation
**Goal**: Automated CI/CD for Docker images with version tracking and mismatch detection in CLI
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (Remote Host Management)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Combines version tracking with CI/CD automation. GitHub Actions build and push versioned Docker images to GHCR. CLI detects when local image version differs from CLI version and prompts to pull/rebuild. Includes version bump workflows for releases.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. GitHub Action workflow builds and pushes Docker images to GHCR on release
  2. Multi-arch images (amd64, arm64) built via buildx
  3. Images tagged with version (e.g., `ghcr.io/prizz/opencode-cloud:1.0.8`) and `:latest`
  4. Docker images include version label (`org.opencode-cloud.version`)
  5. On `occ start`, CLI detects if image version differs from CLI version
  6. User is prompted to pull new image when version mismatch detected
  7. `occ status` shows image version alongside CLI version
  8. Workflow for version bumps with user input (major/minor/patch selection)
  9. Version bump updates all relevant files (Cargo.toml, package.json, etc.) and creates git tag
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — GitHub Actions Docker build workflow (buildx multi-arch, GHCR push, version labels)
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — Version detection in CLI (image version check, mismatch prompt, status display)
- [x] 14-03-PLAN.md — Version bump workflow (workflow_dispatch, semver calculation, tag creation)

### Phase 15: Prebuilt Image Option
**Goal**: Give users the choice between pulling a prebuilt Docker image (fast, ~2 min) or building from source (customizable, 30-60 min)
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (Interactive Setup Wizard), Phase 14 (CI/CD infrastructure)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: CI/CD for prebuilt images was completed in Phase 14. This phase adds user-facing choice, CLI flags, config options, and provenance tracking. Users who don't need customization can pull prebuilt; those who want transparency can build locally.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On first run, user is prompted: "Pull prebuilt image (~2 min) or build from source (30-60 min)?"
  2. Clear explanation of trade-offs shown (prebuilt = faster, build = customizable/auditable)
  3. New config option `image_source` with values: `prebuilt`, `build` (default: prebuilt)
  4. New config option `update_check` with values: `always`, `once`, `never` (default: always)
  5. `occ start --pull-sandbox-image` forces pull of prebuilt image
  6. `occ start --cached-rebuild-sandbox-image` rebuilds with cache
  7. `occ start --full-rebuild-sandbox-image` rebuilds without cache
  8. `occ update` respects image_source config (pulls if prebuilt, builds if build)
  9. `occ status` shows image provenance (source and registry)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — Config schema extension (image_source, update_check) and image state module for provenance
- [x] 15-02-PLAN.md — Start command enhancement (renamed flags, pull-or-build logic, first-run prompt)
- [x] 15-03-PLAN.md — Wizard integration, update command respects config, status shows provenance

### Phase 16: Code Quality Audit
**Goal**: Improve code maintainability by reducing nesting, eliminating duplication, and applying consistent patterns
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (Polish and Documentation)
**Requirements**: None (maintenance/refactoring)
**Note**: Audit the entire codebase for deeply nested logic, duplicated code, and inconsistent patterns. Apply early returns, guard clauses, and extract helper functions where appropriate. This is a refactoring-only phase with no functional changes.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. No function exceeds 3 levels of nesting (excluding match arms)
  2. Duplicated logic extracted into shared helpers or traits

  4. User can specify read-only mounts via `:ro` suffix
  5. Invalid paths (non-existent directories) are validated before container start
  6. `occ start --mount /path:/container/path` allows one-time mount without persisting to config
  7. `occ status` shows active bind mounts
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 17-01: TBD (config schema for mounts, validation)
- [ ] 17-02: TBD (container creation with bind mounts)
- [ ] 17-03: TBD (CLI commands and status display)

### Phase 18: CLI Sync Strategy
**Goal**: Develop and implement a strategy to ensure the Rust CLI and Node CLI remain feature-complete and behavior-consistent
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (Polish and Documentation)
**Requirements**: None (architecture/maintenance)
**Note**: The project has two CLI entry points: packages/cli-rust (native Rust binary) and packages/cli-node (Node.js wrapper using NAPI bindings to core). Both should expose identical commands with identical behavior. This phase establishes patterns, testing, and automation to prevent drift.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Documented strategy for CLI parity (which is source of truth, how to sync)
  2. Shared command definitions or generated from single source
  3. Test suite validates both CLIs produce identical output for all commands

**Depends on**: Phase 15 (Prebuilt Image Option)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Builds on Phase 15's prebuilt image infrastructure. Adds automated CI/CD workflows for building and pushing Docker images to GHCR, plus interactive version bump workflows that prompt for version type (major/minor/patch) and create git tags.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. GitHub Action workflow builds and pushes Docker images to GHCR on release
  2. Multi-arch images (amd64, arm64) built via buildx
  3. Workflow for version bumps with user input (major/minor/patch selection)

**Goal**: Provide "Deploy to Cloud" buttons in README that let users spin up a fully-configured opencode-cloud instance on major cloud providers with minimal configuration
**Depends on**: Phase 15 (Prebuilt Image Option), Phase 19 (CI/CD Automation)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Uses cloud-init, Terraform templates, or provider-specific launch configurations (AWS CloudFormation, GCP Deployment Manager, Azure ARM templates) to provision a VM with Docker and opencode-cloud pre-installed. Users click a button, configure basics (region, instance size, SSH key), and get a running instance.

- [ ] 20-02: TBD (AWS CloudFormation template and deploy button)
- [ ] 20-03: TBD (GCP/Azure/DigitalOcean templates)

### Phase 21: Use opencode Fork with PAM Authentication
**Goal**: Switch from mainline opencode to the pRizz fork (https://github.com/pRizz/opencode) which implements proper PAM-based web authentication
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (Security and Authentication)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: The mainline opencode uses basic auth stored in config. The pRizz fork integrates with PAM for web authentication, allowing users created via `occ user add` to authenticate directly to the opencode web UI using the same container system users that Cockpit uses.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Dockerfile updated to install opencode from https://github.com/pRizz/opencode
  2. Users created via `occ user add` can log into opencode web UI
  3. Authentication is consistent between Cockpit and opencode (same PAM users)
  4. Legacy auth_username/auth_password config fields deprecated or removed
  5. Documentation updated to reflect PAM-based authentication flow
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 21-01: TBD (Dockerfile update and PAM integration)

### Phase 22: Dedupe CLI Logic
**Goal**: Consolidate CLI logic so the Rust CLI is the single source of truth and the Node CLI delegates to it
**Depends on**: Phase 18 (CLI Sync Strategy)
**Requirements**: None (architecture/maintenance)
**Note**: Currently both CLIs have separate implementations. This phase makes the Rust CLI the authoritative implementation, with the Node CLI either wrapping the Rust binary or using NAPI bindings that delegate all logic to the Rust core.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Rust CLI contains all command logic
  2. Node CLI delegates to Rust (via NAPI bindings or subprocess)
  3. No duplicated business logic between CLIs
  4. Both CLIs produce identical output for all commands
  5. Adding new commands only requires changes to Rust CLI
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 22-01: TBD (audit current duplication, design consolidation strategy)
- [ ] 22-02: TBD (implement consolidation)

### Phase 23: Container Shell Access
**Goal**: Provide quick terminal access to the running container via `occ shell` command
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (Service Lifecycle Commands)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Users often need quick shell access without going through Cockpit. This command provides `docker exec -it` functionality with a simpler interface.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `occ shell` opens interactive bash session in running container
  2. `occ shell <command>` executes single command and returns output
  3. Works with remote hosts via `--host` flag
  4. Proper TTY handling for interactive sessions
  5. Exit code propagation from container commands
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 23-01: TBD (shell command implementation)

### Phase 24: IDE Integration
**Goal**: Create extensions for popular IDEs to connect to and work with opencode containers
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (Remote Host Management)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: IDE integration allows developers to use their preferred editor while leveraging the sandboxed container environment. Focus on VS Code first (largest market share), then JetBrains.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. VS Code extension can list running opencode containers
  2. VS Code extension can connect to container for remote development
  3. Extension respects existing SSH config for remote hosts

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 24-01: TBD (VS Code extension)
- [ ] 24-02: TBD (JetBrains plugin - optional)

### Phase 25: Container Templates
**Goal**: Provide pre-configured environment templates optimized for different development stacks
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (Docker Integration)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Different projects need different tools. Templates provide optimized Dockerfiles for specific stacks (Python ML with CUDA, Node.js with common tools, Rust development, etc.) without bloating the default image.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `occ start --template python-ml` uses Python/ML-optimized image
  2. At least 3 templates available: python-ml, nodejs, rust
  3. Templates can be listed via `occ templates list`
  4. Custom templates can be added via config
  5. Template selection persisted in config for container

**Goal**: Securely inject API keys and credentials into the container without exposing them in config files
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (Interactive Setup Wizard)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Users need to provide API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to opencode. Currently these may end up in config files or shell history. This phase provides secure secret injection using Docker secrets or environment variable management.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `occ secret set OPENAI_API_KEY` securely stores secret
  2. Secrets injected into container as environment variables
  3. Secrets never written to plain-text config files
  4. `occ secret list` shows secret names (not values)
  5. `occ secret remove <name>` removes a secret
  6. Secrets persist across container restarts
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 26-01: TBD (secure secret storage)
- [ ] 26-02: TBD (CLI commands and container injection)

### Phase 27: Windows Support
**Goal**: Full Windows compatibility for the CLI and Docker integration
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (Platform Service Installation)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Windows support was deferred from v1. This phase adds Windows service integration, path handling, and testing. Requires Docker Desktop or WSL2 with Docker.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. CLI compiles and runs on Windows
  2. Windows service registration (similar to systemd/launchd)
  3. Config paths follow Windows conventions (%APPDATA%)
  4. All existing commands work on Windows
  5. CI includes Windows build and test
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 27-01: TBD (Windows compilation and path handling)
- [ ] 27-02: TBD (Windows service integration)
- [ ] 27-03: TBD (CI and testing)

### Phase 28: Remote Host Setup Wizard
**Goal**: Run the interactive setup wizard for remote hosts via `occ setup --host <name>`
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (Remote Host Management), Phase 5 (Interactive Setup Wizard)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Currently setup wizard only works locally. This phase extends it to configure remote hosts, creating users in remote containers and managing remote config. Builds on the --host flag added to setup in Phase 15.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `occ setup --host <name>` runs wizard targeting remote host
  2. User creation happens in remote container
  3. Config changes apply to remote host's container
  4. Restart prompt respects remote host context
  5. Clear messaging indicates remote vs local operation
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 28-01: TBD (remote wizard implementation)
