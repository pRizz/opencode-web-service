# Roadmap: opencode-cloud

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a cross-platform CLI toolkit for deploying opencode as a persistent cloud service. Starting with project foundation and CLI skeletons, we build up Docker management, service lifecycle commands, platform-specific service installation, an interactive setup wizard, security/authentication, update capabilities, and finish with polish and documentation. Each phase delivers a coherent, testable capability that builds toward the core value: developers accessing a persistent, secure opencode instance from anywhere.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
**Goal**: Establish monorepo structure with working npm and cargo CLI entry points that can read/write configuration
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: INST-01, CONF-04, CONF-07, CONS-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can install via `npx opencode-cloud --version` and see version output (compiles from source; Rust 1.85+ required)

**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: INST-02, INST-03, INST-04, INST-05, CONF-01, CONF-02, CONF-03, CONF-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running the CLI for first time launches interactive wizard
  2. Wizard prompts for username and password for basic auth
  3. Wizard prompts for port and hostname with sensible defaults shown
  4. User can skip API key configuration to set it later in opencode
  5. User can view current config via `opencode-cloud config`
  6. User can modify config values via `opencode-cloud config set <key> <value>`

**Goal**: Service is secure by default with explicit opt-in for network exposure
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: SECU-01, SECU-02, SECU-03, SECU-04
**Note**: Auth credentials configured here are for opencode's web UI (passed to opencode process). Credentials are stored in the host config file at the platform-appropriate path. Future remote terminal/desktop features (v2/v3) may introduce a separate auth layer.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Basic authentication is required to access the opencode web UI
  2. User chooses auth method during wizard; credentials passed to opencode process
  3. Service binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default
  4. User must explicitly configure network exposure (0.0.0.0 binding)
  5. Warning is displayed when enabling network exposure
  6. Service works correctly behind AWS ALB/ELB with SSL termination
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01: TBD (opencode authentication configuration)

### Phase 8: Polish and Documentation
**Goal**: CLI provides excellent UX with clear help and clean uninstall
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: INST-06, INST-07, INST-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All commands display helpful usage via `--help`
  2. Error messages are clear and include actionable guidance
  3. User can cleanly uninstall via `opencode-cloud uninstall`
  4. Uninstall removes service registration, config files, and optionally Docker volumes
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01: TBD (help documentation)
- [ ] 08-02: TBD (error handling and uninstall)

### Phase 9: Dockerfile Version Pinning
**Goal**: Pin explicit versions for tools installed from GitHub in the Dockerfile to improve security and reproducibility
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: The custom Dockerfile installs many tools from GitHub releases without version pinning. This phase will review each tool and set explicit versions for security and repeatability.

### Phase 10: Remote Administration via Cockpit
**Goal**: Integrate and expose remote administration of the Docker container via Cockpit running in the container
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Provides a web-based admin interface for managing the containerized environment, complementing the CLI for users who prefer GUI access.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Cockpit is installed and running in the Docker container
  2. Cockpit web interface is accessible via a dedicated port
  3. Authentication is integrated with existing opencode-cloud credentials
  4. User can manage container services and view system status via Cockpit
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01: TBD (Cockpit installation and configuration)

### Phase 11: Remote Host Management
**Goal**: Allow occ command to remotely install and interact with Docker containers running on different hosts
