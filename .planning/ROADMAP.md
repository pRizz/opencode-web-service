# Roadmap: opencode-cloud

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a cross-platform CLI toolkit for deploying opencode as a persistent cloud service. Starting with project foundation and CLI skeletons, we build up Docker management, service lifecycle commands, platform-specific service installation, an interactive setup wizard, security/authentication, update capabilities, and finish with polish and documentation. Each phase delivers a coherent, testable capability that builds toward the core value: developers accessing a persistent, secure opencode instance from anywhere.

- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Interactive setup wizard with auto-trigger and setup command

### Phase 6: Security and Authentication
**Goal**: Service is secure by default with explicit opt-in for network exposure
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: SECU-01, SECU-02, SECU-03, SECU-04
**Note**: PAM-based authentication - opencode authenticates via PAM, so opencode-cloud manages system users in the container. Credentials are stored in the container's /etc/shadow (not in host config file). Users are tracked in config.users[] for persistence across rebuilds.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Basic authentication is required to access the opencode web UI
  2. User manages container users via `occ user add/remove/list/passwd/enable/disable`
  3. Service binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default
  4. User must explicitly configure network exposure (0.0.0.0 binding)
  5. Warning is displayed when enabling network exposure
  6. Service works correctly behind AWS ALB/ELB with SSL termination (trust_proxy config)
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Config schema extension (bind_address, trust_proxy, rate_limit, users) and Docker exec/users modules
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — occ user commands (add, remove, list, passwd, enable, disable)
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Network binding controls (bind_address config, container port binding, security warnings)
- [x] 06-04-PLAN.md — Status Security section and wizard PAM user creation integration
- [x] 06-05-PLAN.md — Config support for trust_proxy, rate_limit_*, allow_unauthenticated_network

### Phase 7: Update and Maintenance
**Goal**: User can update opencode and monitor service health
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: LIFE-06, LIFE-07, CONF-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can update to latest opencode via `opencode-cloud update`
  2. Update preserves existing configuration and data volumes
  3. Health check endpoint available at `/health` for monitoring tools
  4. Configuration is validated on service startup with clear error messages for invalid config
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Update command with rollback support and progress feedback
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Health check endpoint and config validation with actionable errors

### Phase 8: Polish and Documentation
**Goal**: CLI provides excellent UX with clear help and clean uninstall
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: INST-06, INST-07, INST-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All commands display helpful usage via `--help`
  2. Error messages are clear and include actionable guidance
  3. User can cleanly uninstall via `opencode-cloud uninstall`
  4. Uninstall removes service registration, config files, and optionally Docker volumes
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01-PLAN.md — Uninstall UX improvements (confirmation prompt, remaining file paths display)

### Phase 9: Dockerfile Version Pinning
**Goal**: Pin explicit versions for tools installed from GitHub in the Dockerfile to improve security and reproducibility
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: The custom Dockerfile installs many tools from GitHub releases without version pinning. This phase will review each tool and set explicit versions for security and repeatability.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All GitHub-installed tools have explicit version tags (not :latest)
  2. Version pinning documented in Dockerfile comments
  3. Image builds are reproducible given same Dockerfile
  4. Security: Supply chain risk reduced by pinning to known-good versions
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01: TBD (audit and pin versions)

### Phase 10: Remote Administration via Cockpit
**Goal**: Integrate and expose remote administration of the Docker container via Cockpit running in the container
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Provides a web-based admin interface for managing the containerized environment, complementing the CLI for users who prefer GUI access.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Cockpit is installed and running in the Docker container
  2. Cockpit web interface is accessible via a dedicated port
  3. Authentication is integrated with existing opencode-cloud credentials
  4. User can manage container services and view system status via Cockpit
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01: TBD (Cockpit installation and configuration)

### Phase 11: Remote Host Management
**Goal**: Allow occ command to remotely install and interact with Docker containers running on different hosts
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Extends the CLI to manage opencode instances across multiple machines via SSH or Docker API, enabling centralized management of distributed deployments.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can add remote hosts via `occ host add <hostname>`
  2. User can list and manage containers on remote hosts
  3. Secure connection to remote Docker daemons (SSH tunnel or TLS)
  4. Commands work transparently across local and remote hosts
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01: TBD (remote host management)

### Phase 12: Web Desktop UI Investigation
**Goal**: Investigate integrating a secure web-exposed full custom browser desktop UI such as Friend OS, WDE, or similar
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: None (research/enhancement)
**Note**: Research phase to evaluate web desktop environments that could provide a full graphical interface to the containerized environment, accessible securely via browser.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Candidate web desktop solutions evaluated (Friend OS, WDE, others)
  2. Security implications documented (auth, isolation, network exposure)
  3. Integration feasibility assessed with current Docker architecture
  4. Recommendation made: proceed with implementation or defer

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 12-01: TBD (research and evaluation)

### Phase 13: Container Security Tools
**Goal**: Add security scanning and secrets management tools to the container image
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Deferred from initial Dockerfile to reduce image size and build time. Adds trivy, gitleaks, hadolint, age, sops, mkcert.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. trivy installed for vulnerability scanning
  2. gitleaks installed for secret detection
  3. hadolint installed for Dockerfile linting
  4. age and sops installed for secrets management
  5. mkcert installed for local TLS certificate generation
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 13-01: TBD (security tools installation)

### Phase 14: Auto-rebuild Detection
**Goal**: Automatically detect when CLI version doesn't match the built Docker image and prompt user to rebuild
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (Update and Maintenance)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: The Dockerfile is embedded in the CLI binary. When users update opencode-cloud, the embedded Dockerfile may have changed, but Docker won't know to rebuild. This phase adds version tracking to detect mismatches and prompt users to rebuild.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Docker images are tagged with opencode-cloud version (e.g., `ghcr.io/prizz/opencode-cloud:0.1.4`)
  2. On `occ start`, CLI detects if existing image version differs from current CLI version
  3. User is prompted to rebuild when version mismatch detected
  4. Option to auto-rebuild on version mismatch via config setting
  5. `occ status` shows image version alongside CLI version
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 14-01: TBD (version tagging and mismatch detection)

### Phase 15: Prebuilt Image Option
**Goal**: Give users the choice between pulling a prebuilt Docker image (fast) or building from source (customizable)
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (Interactive Setup Wizard)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Building the Docker image from the embedded Dockerfile takes 10-15 minutes due to compiling Rust tools, installing language runtimes, etc. Users who don't need customization can pull a prebuilt image in ~1-2 minutes. This phase adds CI/CD to publish images and prompts users during first run.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. CI/CD pipeline publishes prebuilt images to GHCR on release
  2. On first run, user is prompted: "Pull prebuilt image (~2 min) or build from source (~15 min)?"
  3. Clear explanation of trade-offs shown (prebuilt = faster, build = customizable/latest)
  4. New config option `image_source` with values: `prebuilt`, `build`, `ask` (default)
  5. `occ start --pull` forces pull of prebuilt image
  6. `occ start --build` forces build from source (like current `--cached-rebuild` but for first run)
  7. Prebuilt images are multi-arch (amd64, arm64) for cross-platform support
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 15-01: TBD (CI/CD for prebuilt images)
- [ ] 15-02: TBD (first-run prompt and config option)

### Phase 16: Code Quality Audit
**Goal**: Improve code maintainability by reducing nesting, eliminating duplication, and applying consistent patterns
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (Polish and Documentation)
**Requirements**: None (maintenance/refactoring)
**Note**: Audit the entire codebase for deeply nested logic, duplicated code, and inconsistent patterns. Apply early returns, guard clauses, and extract helper functions where appropriate. This is a refactoring-only phase with no functional changes.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. No function exceeds 3 levels of nesting (excluding match arms)
  2. Duplicated logic extracted into shared helpers or traits
  3. Early returns and guard clauses used consistently
  4. All files pass `cargo clippy` with no warnings
  5. No regression in test coverage or functionality
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 16-01: TBD (audit and identify problem areas)
- [ ] 16-02: TBD (refactor CLI commands)
- [ ] 16-03: TBD (refactor core library)

### Phase 17: Custom Bind Mounts
**Goal**: Allow users to specify local filesystem directories to mount into the Docker container
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (Interactive Setup Wizard - for config UI)
**Requirements**: None (enhancement)
**Note**: Users often want to work with local project directories inside the container. This phase adds configuration and CLI options to specify bind mounts that map host paths to container paths.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can add bind mounts via `occ config set mounts "/path/on/host:/path/in/container"`
  2. User can add multiple mounts (array in config)
  3. Mounts are applied when container starts
  4. User can specify read-only mounts via `:ro` suffix
  5. Invalid paths (non-existent directories) are validated before container start
  6. `occ start --mount /path:/container/path` allows one-time mount without persisting to config
  7. `occ status` shows active bind mounts
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 17-01: TBD (config schema for mounts, validation)
- [ ] 17-02: TBD (container creation with bind mounts)
- [ ] 17-03: TBD (CLI commands and status display)

### Phase 18: CLI Sync Strategy
**Goal**: Develop and implement a strategy to ensure the Rust CLI and Node CLI remain feature-complete and behavior-consistent
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (Polish and Documentation)
**Requirements**: None (architecture/maintenance)
**Note**: The project has two CLI entry points: packages/cli-rust (native Rust binary) and packages/cli-node (Node.js wrapper using NAPI bindings to core). Both should expose identical commands with identical behavior. This phase establishes patterns, testing, and automation to prevent drift.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Documented strategy for CLI parity (which is source of truth, how to sync)
  2. Shared command definitions or generated from single source
  3. Test suite validates both CLIs produce identical output for all commands
  4. CI fails if CLIs diverge in behavior or available commands
  5. Clear process for adding new commands to both CLIs
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 18-01: TBD (audit current state, document strategy)
- [ ] 18-02: TBD (shared definitions or code generation)
- [ ] 18-03: TBD (parity test suite and CI integration)
