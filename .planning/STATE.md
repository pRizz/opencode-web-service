# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-18)

**Core value:** Developers can access a persistent, secure opencode instance from anywhere without wrestling with Docker, service management, or cloud infrastructure details.
**Current focus:** Phase 17 - Custom Bind Mounts (In Progress)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Use opencode's built-in basic auth (avoid reinventing)
- [Init]: Google Drive sync deferred to v2 (reduce scope)

- [Phase 1]: Monorepo: packages/core, packages/cli-rust, packages/cli-node
- [Phase 1]: JSONC config at ~/.config/opencode-cloud/config.json
- [Phase 1]: Windows support deferred to v2

- [01-01]: Dual crate-type: Core library uses both cdylib (for NAPI) and rlib (for Rust CLI)
- [01-02]: XDG paths for macOS: Use ~/.config/ instead of ~/Library for consistency
- [01-02]: Singleton via kill -0: Use subprocess call for process existence check

- [09-02]: Weekly schedule: Monday 9am UTC for version checks via CI workflow
- [10-01]: systemd as PID 1: Required for Cockpit socket activation
- [10-01]: Minimal Cockpit packages: cockpit-ws, cockpit-system, cockpit-bridge
- [10-01]: AllowUnencrypted=true: TLS terminated externally like opencode
- [10-01]: Keep tini in image: Backward compatibility, though systemd now default
- [10-01]: STOPSIGNAL SIGRTMIN+3: Proper systemd shutdown signal
- [10-02]: Default cockpit_port 9090: Standard Cockpit port
- [10-02]: Default cockpit_enabled true: Cockpit integrated in image

- [11-02]: Partial updates on edit - only specified fields change
- [11-03]: Global --host flag on Cli struct for all commands to inherit
- [11-03]: resolve_docker_client helper centralizes host resolution logic
- [11-03]: Host resolution order: explicit --host > default_host from hosts.json > local Docker
- [11-03]: format_host_message helper ensures consistent [hostname] prefix formatting
- [11-03]: User subcommands accept DockerClient reference instead of creating own
- [14-01]: GHCR as primary Docker registry: ghcr.io/prizz/opencode-cloud
- [14-01]: Version label: org.opencode-cloud.version in Dockerfile
- [14-01]: Multi-arch via QEMU: Simpler than ARM runners, acceptable for slow image builds
- [14-01]: VERSION file at /etc/opencode-cloud-version for runtime access
- [14-02]: Version check skipped during rebuilds: No point checking if we're rebuilding anyway
- [14-02]: Dev version always compatible: Local builds treated as compatible

- [14-03]: Two-tag strategy: Both v* and release/v* for backward compatibility
- [14-03]: GitHub Actions bot for commits: Clear audit trail, avoids CI loops
- [15-01]: Image source defaults to "prebuilt": Most users want fast setup; pull from GHCR is faster than local build
- [15-01]: Update check defaults to "always": Security patches should be discovered automatically
- [15-01]: State file location in data directory: Image state is operational/ephemeral (which image is current)
- [15-01]: ISO8601 timestamps via chrono::Utc: Standardized format, timezone-aware, sortable
- [15-03]: Wizard always prompts for image source: Even in quick setup, choice between 2-min pull vs 60-min build warrants explicit user input
- [15-03]: Update shows informational messages: Display which method (build/pull) is used and how to change it
- [15-03]: Graceful provenance display: Status shows image provenance when state file exists, silently skips if missing
- [16-01]: Docker error formatting centralized: output/errors.rs module with format_docker_error, show_docker_error
- [16-02]: URL helper location: output/urls.rs module consistent with output module pattern
- [17-01]: Mount format: /host:/container[:ro|rw] with rw as default
- [17-01]: System paths warning: /etc, /usr, /bin, /sbin, /lib, /var
- [17-01]: Validation uses canonicalize() to resolve symlinks and verify existence

### Pending Todos

1. **Make README sync more robust** (tooling) - Add CI check to verify package READMEs match root; consider husky/lefthook for cross-platform hook management.
