## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Use opencode's built-in basic auth (avoid reinventing)
- [Init]: Google Drive sync deferred to v2 (reduce scope)
- [Phase 1]: Project renamed to `opencode-cloud` (CLI: `occ`)
- [Phase 1]: Rust core + NAPI-RS bindings architecture
- [Phase 1]: Monorepo: packages/core, packages/cli-rust, packages/cli-node
- [Phase 1]: JSONC config at ~/.config/opencode-cloud/config.json
- [Phase 1]: Windows support deferred to v2
- [01-01]: Feature flag for NAPI: Use cargo feature 'napi' to conditionally compile NAPI bindings
- [01-01]: Manual JS bindings: Generate index.js/index.d.ts manually due to napi-cli type generation issues
- [01-01]: Dual crate-type: Core library uses both cdylib (for NAPI) and rlib (for Rust CLI)
- [01-02]: XDG paths for macOS: Use ~/.config/ instead of ~/Library for consistency
- [01-02]: Singleton via kill -0: Use subprocess call for process existence check
- [01-02]: Strict config validation: deny_unknown_fields rejects unknown keys
- [Phase 1]: No prebuilt binaries: Both npm and crates.io compile from source; Rust 1.85+ required for transparency

### Pending Todos

1. **Make README sync more robust** (tooling) - Add CI check to verify package READMEs match root; consider husky/lefthook for cross-platform hook management.
2. **Handle pnpm v10 blocked install scripts** (tooling) - Add runtime guard with actionable error for pnpm users; document workaround in README.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
