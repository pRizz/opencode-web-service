# AWS Quick Deploy (One-Click)

Deploy opencode-cloud on AWS with a public Application Load Balancer (ALB) and
HTTPS via ACM, while keeping the EC2 instance private by default.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to create EC2, ALB, ACM, and IAM resources.
- A domain name you control (required for ACM TLS validation).
- Ability to edit DNS records for the domain.
- A Route53 hosted zone for the domain (required for automated validation).

## Quick Deploy

1. Click the AWS deploy button in the root `README.md`.
2. Provide a **domain name** (e.g., `opencode.example.com`).
3. Provide the Route53 hosted zone ID for automatic DNS validation.
4. Create the stack.
5. If ACM validation is stuck, verify the CNAME record in Route53.
6. Point your domain to the ALB DNS name (create an ALIAS or CNAME).
7. Wait for stack completion, then open `https://<your-domain>`.

Cockpit is available at `https://<your-domain>/cockpit`.

## CloudFormation Template Hosting (S3 Required)

AWS CloudFormation requires `templateURL` to point to an S3-hosted file. This
repo publishes `infra/aws/cloudformation` to S3 via GitHub Actions so the Launch
Stack button always references a public S3 URL.

### Fork Setup (One-Time)

1. **Create an S3 bucket** for templates (example: `opencode-cloud-templates`).
2. **Allow public reads** for the template prefix (or use signed URLs). Minimal
   bucket policy example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadCloudFormationTemplates",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET/cloudformation/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Create GitHub OIDC access** in AWS (recommended):
   - Create an IAM OIDC provider for `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`.
   - Create a role that trusts your repo (`repo:ORG/REPO:*`), grants S3 write
     access to the bucket/prefix, and includes `AWSCloudFormationReadOnlyAccess`
     so the workflow can run template validation from the GitHub Action
     [`publish-cloudformation.yml`](../../.github/workflows/publish-cloudformation.yml)
     and upload the templates to the bucket.
4. **Set GitHub repository secrets/vars**:
   - `AWS_ROLE_ARN` (secret)
   - `AWS_CFN_BUCKET` (variable, must match README Launch Stack URL)
   - `AWS_CFN_PREFIX` (variable, optional, default `cloudformation`)
   - `AWS_REGION` (variable, optional, default `us-east-1`)
5. **Run the workflow**: `.github/workflows/publish-cloudformation.yml` (push to
   `main` or run manually).
6. **Update the Launch Stack URL** in `README.md` and `packages/core/README.md`
   to point at your bucket:

```
https://s3.amazonaws.com/YOUR_BUCKET/cloudformation/opencode-cloud-quick.yaml
```

For non-`us-east-1` buckets, use the regional endpoint:

```
https://YOUR_BUCKET.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/opencode-cloud-quick.yaml
```

## Required Parameters

- **DomainName**: Fully-qualified domain name for HTTPS. ACM requires DNS
  validation before the listener becomes active.

## Outputs

- **OpencodeUrl**: Primary HTTPS URL.
- **CockpitUrl**: Cockpit HTTPS URL (`/cockpit`).
- **AlbDnsName**: ALB DNS name for debugging and DNS setup.
- **CertificateArn**: ACM certificate ARN.
- **InstanceId**: EC2 instance ID.
- **VpcId**, **PublicSubnets**, **PrivateSubnet**: Networking details.
- **CredentialsSecretArn**: Secrets Manager ARN containing generated credentials.

## Retrieving Credentials

Credentials are generated during provisioning and stored in AWS Secrets
Manager. The stack outputs `CredentialsSecretArn`.

Fetch the secret:

```bash
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \
  --secret-id <credentials-secret-arn> \
  --query SecretString \
  --output text
```

The secret includes the username, password, and URLs. `/etc/motd` shows the
username and secret ARN, but not the password.

## opencode-cloud CLI on the host

The quick deploy installs the `opencode-cloud` CLI via `cargo install` during
provisioning. This pulls the latest published version at deploy time (Rust
1.85+ required) and can add several minutes to first boot.

You can check the installed version on the instance:

```bash
opencode-cloud --version
```

## Advanced Parameters

### Instance

- **InstanceType**: Override the default `t3.medium`. Smaller sizes (t3/t3a
  micro or small) may be unstable under load.
- **RootVolumeSize**: Root EBS volume size in GiB (default: 30).
- **KeyPairName**: Required. Use SSH to retrieve credentials if needed:
  `ssh -i /path/key.pem ubuntu@<alb-dns>` then
  `sudo cat /var/lib/opencode-cloud/deploy-status.json`.
  More details in the GitHub docs:
  https://github.com/pRizz/opencode-cloud/blob/main/docs/deploy/aws.md
- **OpencodeUsername**: Customize the initial username.

### Networking

- **UseExistingVpc**: Set to `true` to deploy into an existing VPC.
- If `UseExistingVpc=false`, the stack creates a new VPC with public/private
  subnets and a NAT gateway for outbound access.
- **ExistingVpcId**: Required if using an existing VPC.
- **ExistingPublicSubnetIds**: Public subnets for the ALB (must allow internet).
- **ExistingPrivateSubnetId**: Private subnet for the instance (must have NAT
  egress so the instance can pull the container image).
- **AllowSsh**: Enable SSH access (defaults to SSM-only).
- **SshIngressCidr**: Limit SSH access to a trusted CIDR range.

### TLS

- **HostedZoneId**: Required. Used to create ACM DNS validation records in
  Route53.

### Image

- **OpencodeImage**: Override the container image (defaults to GHCR latest).

## Troubleshooting

- **ACM validation stuck**: Ensure the CNAME record is created exactly as shown
  in ACM and that DNS has propagated.
- **HTTPS not working**: Confirm the domain points to the ALB and the ACM
  certificate is issued.
- **Health checks failing**: Check `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` and run
  `docker ps` on the instance to confirm the container is running.
- **Cockpit not loading**: Verify the `/cockpit` path and that port 9090 is
  reachable from the ALB security group.

## Teardown / Uninstall

To remove all AWS resources created by the quick deploy:

1. **Delete the CloudFormation stack** from the AWS console or CLI. This
   removes the ALB, EC2 instance, security groups, and networking created by
   the stack.
2. **Remove DNS records** you created for the domain:
   - Delete the ALIAS/CNAME that points to the ALB.
   - Delete the ACM validation CNAME if you added it manually.
3. **Check ACM certificates** (optional): if you requested a certificate
   outside the stack, remove it manually.

If you deployed into an existing VPC or subnets, those shared resources are
not deleted when the stack is removed.
